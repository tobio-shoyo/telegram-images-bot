# This bot is a little gift I've made for my friend use webhook.
* It use `flask` to make a small server and `pyTelegramBotAPI` to handle commands
* It calls api's of [pixabay](https://pixabay.com/api/docs/) to get data and display to users
* It's hosted on [glitch](https://glitch.com/) at [my project](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/telegram-teddy-bot)
* I provided a webhook URL for my bot. Whenever a new update for this bot arrives, Telegram sends that update to the specified URL
