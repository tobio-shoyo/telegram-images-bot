# This bot is a little gift I've made for my friend use webhook.

- I make a small server using `flask` to listen events and use `pyTelegramBotAPI` to handle commands of the bot
- It calls photos api of [pixabay](https://pixabay.com/api/docs/) to get photos according to the keyword, it recieves in the chat message and display the corresponding results to users
- It's hosted on [glitch](https://glitch.com/) by adding this [glitch.json](https://support.glitch.com/t/hello-i-need-help-because-i-need-to-be-able-to-use-the-command-for-python-to-help-me-create-a-json-image-ai-in-python/17468) to enable python3 code at [my project](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/telegram-images-bot)
- I provided a webhook URL for my bot. Whenever a new update for this bot arrives, Telegram sends that update to the specified URL
