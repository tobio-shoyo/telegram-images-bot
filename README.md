# This bot is a little gift I've made for my friend use webhook.
* I make a small server using `flask` to listen events and use `pyTelegramBotAPI` to handle commands of the bot
* It calls photos api of [pixabay](https://pixabay.com/api/docs/) to get photos according to the keyword, it recieves in the chat message and display the corresponding results to users
* It's hosted on [glitch](https://glitch.com/) at [my project](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/telegram-images-bot)
* I provided a webhook URL for my bot. Whenever a new update for this bot arrives, Telegram sends that update to the specified URL
